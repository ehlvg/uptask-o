## why uptask?

because task management shouldn't be complicated. we built uptask with a few principles in mind:

- **calm over chaos** — a peaceful interface that doesn't overwhelm
- **focus over features** — only what you need, nothing you don't
- **privacy over profit** — your data is yours, secured by design
- **simplicity over complexity** — straightforward workflows that just work
